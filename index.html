        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                I was born in Lynchburg, Virginia and grew up in a nearby town called Altavista. I spent most of my school years participating in multiple extracurriculars including Band, Soccer, and Spanish Club. Before my Junior year of High School, my family and I moved to Bedford, Virginia where I would go on to graduate from Liberty High School with an advanced diploma.
                <br />
                During Senior Year, I was accepted in to Virginia Commonwealth University's Spanish Language program. I moved to Richmond, Virginia for my studies and found myself working part-time for Bow Tie Cinemas. From there, I went on to learn the inner workings of the Motion Picture Exhibition Industry - getting an inside look at not only all the fascinating things like how projection works, but getting the bigger picture about how movie theaters coordinate with Hollywood Studios to bring movies to the big screen.

            <p>
                Run Buddy is the first project on my path to becoming a Full Stack Developer. For this project, I set out to create a landing page for Run Buddy, a company with the goal of helping people along their fitness journey by setting one up with a personal trainer.

            <p>
                The Code Refactor project was the first graded assignment. A source code was provided, and the assignment's goal was Search Engine Optimization. To reach the goal, the code provided had to be edited to contain proper semantics, descriptive attributes, and working links.
